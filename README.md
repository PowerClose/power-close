Power Close
===================
A browser extension, for the tab addict, to close all tabs with urls containing a keyword or a domain name. For example,
if you have many facebook tabs open and not in order, you can just use this extension, write "facebook.com", hit enter and
voila, all facebook tabs -containing the string 'facebook.com'- are now closed!

Building Locally
=================
1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Build plugin
 * non-minified `node grunt dev`
 * minified `node grunt [dist] # by default runs the 'dist' task`

Usage
=====
After installation, this icon will appear as a button in your browser :

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mos3abof/firefox-power-close/master/data/icon-64.png)

Press on it, and an input field will appear. Write the keyword or domain name in it and press enter, and voila!

Icon
====
The icon used for the logo and the toolbar button is a mash of two icons from Google's
[Material Design Icons](https://design.google.com/icons/) that are published as an open source project under the
[CC-By License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In older versions of the addon, the logo used to be one of the icons designed by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com) from
[Flat Icon](http://www.flaticon.com), that was also licensed under [CC-BY License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/),
although a different version of it.
